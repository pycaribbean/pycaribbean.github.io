    "bio": "Hola, Soy Wildin Mota. Tengo 18 a\u00f1os de edad y actualmente trabajo como Python Developer en PibiCloud, aunque para cuando llegue la conferencia seguro sere FullStack, incluso hasta haciendo Machine Learning pero eso no es seguro aun.\n\nSoy un apasionado del software desde los 14 estoy en esete mundo estudiando por mi cuenta mi primera intereaccion programando era usando bat en windows el cual aprendi en un libro de HackXRank, desde que inicie nunca lo he dejado y siempre me e mantenido curioso ya el resto es historia de estudio y consistencia.\n\nA mis 17 vendi mi primer proyecto de software el cual era un sistema de ventas para la Ferreteria Chelo, este lo hice en C# y SQL Server estaba muy emociado y motivado que hasta amanecia programando, lo mas duro que hice fueron 14 horas seguidas bebi un monton de cafe ese dia para poder aguantar tal trabajo.\n\nA los 18 al graduarme de bachiller en mi pueblo que es la Vega me senti arrinconado y con un futuro escrito en la vega solo una universidad da Software y no hay empresas en esta area interesantes, ademas estaba ansioso de un cambio drastico, a los pocos dias me inscribi en el ITLA sin consentimiento de mis padres yo trabajaba como tecnico asi que pude pagar yo mismo el derecho a admision y los viajes a santo domingo para los examenes, yo desde hace tiempo queria trabajar mientras estaba en la universidad era algo que queria bastante pero al inscribirme en el ITLA se convirtio en necesidad porque mis padres no podian pagarlo y yo tampoco queria que lo hicieran porque era algo que yo queria y yo debia proveermelo por mi mismo, es importante notar que yo enviaba CV's a solo una emprea a la vez y esperaba hasta que em dieran respuesta porque me parecia mal el hecho de ser aceptado por mas de una y despues tener que rechazar a alguien que me dio una oprtunidad pero despues de ver que eso no funcionaba y viendo la necesidad de tener ingresos entre a emplea.do y mande CV a diestra y siniestra en todas que yo tuviera las requisitos incluso Instacarro me devolvio el mensaje pero pospuse la entrevista sin saber que era algo que no se viea muy bien y no volvi a tener respuesta :'( al final una empresa me escribio a las pocas horas de mandar la soclitud y otra me llamo al siguiente dia, me enfoque en esas dos. Para no alargr la historia me quede con la primera empresa que es Castillo Software Solutions estaba para un puesto que solo era HTML y CSS algo que no me ponia muy feliz pero yo se que lo convertiria en algo mas con el tiempo pedi a la empresa que me dieran issues en Angular y asi fue, eso me mantuvo con retos por un tiempo pero aun para mi no era suficiente yo queria ser backend developer y tenia que serlo de una.\n\nA mis 9-10 meses trabajando en CastilloSS un amigo me mando una oferta laboral como Python Dev usando Django/Flask y ademas haciendo Angular e Ionic tecnologias que aprendi para CastilloSS es curioso decir que cuando pedi hacer tareas en angular aun no habia visto un curso basico completo de Angular pero me manejaba bastante bien con JS y me desenvolvi bien, terminaba mis tareas a tiempo y me dejaron solo haciendo Angular.\n\nPues consegui el trabajo y senti que una puerta de un monton de posibilidades se abrio ante mi, es que en esta empresa mi jefe es un genio con un monton de experiencia dispuesto a mostrarnos todo e incluso hizo una seria de libros para volverse senior si los entiendes bien, los cuales ya estoy leyendo, me gusta bastante donde trabajo ahora y pienso ir a ayudar en tantas areas com pueda no hay limites.\n\nCorte bastante la historia para no escribir mas XD, lo siento.\n\n"
