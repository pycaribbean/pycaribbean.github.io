In 30 minutes, this talk explains how you can harness the power of the init system and systemd to solve common deployment problems, including some that you didn't even know you had:\n\n# How to secure your system by having: private /tmp for your process, read-only paths so that your process can not write to them, inaccessible paths, protect users home, network access, bin directories, etc.\n# How to limit the resources you app can consume.\n# How to interact directly with systemd, so it can start transient units, start/stop services, mount disks, resolve addresses.\n# How to isolate your service without containers.\n# How to isolate your service using containers (using systemd to spawn a namespace).\n\nAll this will be covered from a Python developer's perspective.",

    "description": "Test automation is treated like a necessary evil. We know we should automate our tests, but it takes time and effort. **pytest-bdd**, a plugin for the awesome **pytest** framework, makes it *much* easier to write tests by enabling Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) features. Using **pytest-bdd**, teams write tests in plain language using Gherkin (e.g., Given-When-Then steps), and then programmers write Python code to automate the steps. BDD testing is great because tests are self-documenting and steps abide by the DRY principle. And all the goodness of **pytest** is available. An example test could be:\n\n*Given* the DuckDuckGo home page is displayed\n*When* the user searches the phrase \"Python\"\n*Then* search results for \"Python\" are shown\n\nThis talk will teach how to use **pytest-bdd** to develop well-designed test scenarios and a robust automation framework. It will focus on the layers of the **pytest-bdd** framework: feature files, step definitions, and support classes. A full example project will be hosted on GitHub for audience members to reference after the talk.",

    "description": "At the advent of object-oriented programming, inheritance and the class hierarchy reigned supreme. You could model _anything_, from `Animal` all the way down to `Animal` -> `Mammal` -> `Dog` -> `UtilityDog` -> `FrenchBulldog`. Eventually this got out of hand.\n\nToday, composition brings many of the benefits of complex inheritance while keeping functionality focused and isolated. In many languages, composition is achieved via the interface pattern; an object can declare its intent to _implement_ a particular interface and as a result is beholden to support the behaviors that interface outlines. In Python, there is no such thing as an interface! What do we do about that?\n\nFortunately, Python provides the ability to support something interface-like (and more) via _multiple inheritance_. In multiple inheritance, an object may inherit from multiple other objects. Let's explore how this works, what pitfalls to look out for, and how not to repeat the past when dealing with class hierarchies.",

What does Natural Language Processing mean and what are the steps involved?\n\nThis workshop introduces Natural Language Processing to those with previous programming experience, though not necessarily in Python. Attendees start off with textual data and learn how to process it to derive useful insights that can be used in real-world applications. Tools introduced and explored include Jupyter, NLTK, pandas, sklearn and numpy. \n\n* Overview of natural language processing\n* Word and sentence tokenization\n* Part of speech tagging\n* Distance metrics\n* Stemming, lemmatization and word senses\n* Bag of words\n* N-grams\n* Word2Vec and topic modeling\n* Sentiment analysis\n* Brief module on neural nets and chatbots\n* Additional resources\n\nBy the end of this tutorial, participants will be able to apply techniques of Natural language processing to textual datasets and create predictive models along with having sample projects to show in their portfolio. The vision is that participants feel motivated to create NLP-based applications and apply it to real-life examples like chatbots, analyze news sentiments, predicting gender from tweets.",

    "description": "In the workplace, sometimes we may feel that if our work is good, it will speak for itself, relieving us of that responsibility. However for women, research shows that even if the work speaks for itself, the credit is less likely to be given to us. So how do we get the credit for our good work against these challenges? How do we break through unconscious bias, and socialized silence? How can we be our own advocates?\n\nIn this presentation, attendees will hear several strategies for showing your work- tracking your own progress and contribution, and making it visible to those who make decisions about your future. How do you capture and take credit for the emotional and mental labor tasks of your office or project? How do you capture and take credit for the work you do that enables someone else's success? How do you report incremental progress when you are feeling stuck on an issue? All of the work you do, whether it is strictly tangible or not, is work, and should be valued as such. Learning how to report your activities and accomplishments is an important skill, because let's face it- nobody knows the work you do better than you! \n",

    "description": "# How to Hack (Legally): Python Edition\n\n## Abstract\n\nPeople often emphasize that the best way to learn is by doing, but when it comes to hacking, the trainee is at risk of legal implications and developing bad habits instead of following ethical procedures. Many people wishing to develop penetration testing skills are unaware of the number of resources available to them to set up a controlled environment where they can legally test hacking tools and techniques.\n\nIn this lightning talk, I will briefly cover a wide range of resources available to attendees, and how they can be used as learning tools. The resources I will cover include pre-built vulnerable virtual machines and web applications, open source tools that can be used in conjunction with Python for discovery/enumeration/exploitation, competitions and challenges, trainings geared towards hacking with Python, and certifications.\n\nI will also outline general safe practices to ensure attendees understand what is and isn't legal, and the consequences of not staying within ethical boundaries. During the talk, a link will be displayed so that participants can easily save a list of the resources outlined in this talk with additional information to reference later.\n\n## Objectives\n\n- Provide an ongoing centralized repository for helpful resources to promote safe and legal hacking\n- Outline general safe hacking practices to create awareness of what is acceptable and what could result in legal implications\n- Share trusted sources of vulnerable targets which can be used to build a home lab for penetration testing with Python\n- Introduce sources of vetted Python exploits and how to test them while discouraging the use of unknown/untrusted exploits\n- Provide a list of trusted open source tools what can be used for recon, scanning, and exploitation within a home lab\n- Discuss valuable trainings that can be pursued to develop Python hacking skills and potentially obtain certifications\n- Describe the benefits of participating in hacking competitions and challenges, either individually or on a team\n\n## Resource Sample\n\nBelow is a small sample of some of the resources that will be included in the repository and discussed in the lightning talk.\n\n- Vulnerable machines: Vulnhub, Metasploitable\n- Vulnerable web applications: DVWA, bWAPP, XVWA, various OWASP apps/VMs\n- Penetration testing tools: Kali Linux, exploit-db, pypcap, scapy\n- Training/certifications: OSCP, CEH, SANS GPEN, HackerSploit\n- Competitions/challenges: picoCTF, pwnable, MITRE CTF\n",

Yet our community often points to Professional Software Engineering as the \"proper\" way to code. I'll demonstrate that these styles can both be done with basic or advanced Python. After that, I'll look at practices that may benefit one, but not the other, discuss when there may be shifts between the two, and examine how we as existing community members can help guide new members down the path that best fits their goals. This maximizes their chance for success and our chance to add new contributors to our community. Let's not forget: Python is a FLOSS project. We need all the help we can get. This is especially true now that our BDFL has stepped down.\n\nRemember, all software engineers are programmers, but all programmers don't need to be software engineers. But some programmers may become software engineers.",

    "description": "By now you have probably all heard about Python static typing. But why should you care? Are types in Python even Pythonic? Is Python turning into Java? Type annotations are Pythonic, trust Guido's word for it, and Python is definitely not turning into Java.\n\nI joined the Facebook London office in early 2016 after finishing university. At that time my team was running Python 2.7 and we had just 2 engineers. These days we are running 100% typed Python 3.6, have 8 engineers and 3 interns. In 2017 we flipped the switch from 2 to 3 and started aggressively typing the codebase, at that time we had only 3 engs.\n\nIn the first year of the team we managed to hire only 1 eng, the second year 6. So what made the difference? At Facebook, people go through Bootcamp and complete tasks from teams they are interested in before taking a decision on which to join. Having a codebase that's easy to navigate and understand is key to attract talent! Type annotations achieve just that, even without using a type checker.\n\nThe greatest benefit of types in large Python codebases is the fact that the input and output structures of a function are obvious from just looking at the signature. In the untyped world the definition for the class you are looking for may be N jumps away, hidden somewhere deep in the codebase, and you don't have a direct reference to it. In the best possible case grepping for it will yield just a few results and you will be able to spot what you are looking for. In the worst case though, you will have hundreds of hits and you will have to run your application and inspect the type at runtime to figure out what is going on, which make the development cycle slow and tedious.\n\nCome to this talk if you want to know more about the typing system in Python, how to gradually add it to your codebase and what benefits will your team get in the long run! I will also cover FB specific technologies like our runtime type collection system, MonkeyType, and the just open sourced type checker, Pyre!",

After outlining the difficulty of annual reviews with a real life example, I will explain the manual solution of success statements. A success statement is a sentence that explains a single achievement and how it contributes to the bottom line. This is a great place to start, but can be tedious to add up all the information for reports.\n\nThe second part is about the AWS based app I created and how you can use it to store and automatically summarize the data multiple ways. I will explain how serverless apps are a great way for those without DevOps experience to get an app up easily. I'll get into the different ways to manipulate the data and how to deploy the app to have a personal ROI Tracker. The repository is publicly available to make it easy for the attendees to dig in and review the code themselves after the talk.\n",

When you hear artificial intelligence you might think of complex solutions as self-driving cars, autonomous drones and robots or smart assistants as Alexa or Siri - but it doesn't have to be that complex. You can build a powerful image classification model within a topic that inspires and interests you - with 3 easy steps. First, find a topic that interests you; it can be something that inspires you, excites you or a super simple day-to-day problem you're facing. Which of your skills are matching your interests and other topics that excites you? Use that skill set to the next step, which is creating your own data.\n\nMy day-to-day repetitive problem was the daily makeup routine; it takes time and its quite uninspiring but when you finally decide to try something new - you literally get over 30 million results when search for makeup tutorial on Youtube and beauty being a $400 billion industry indicates that makeup play a significant part of people's lives. How do you even know what makeup style will look as good on you as it does on all the YouTubers?\n\nTherefore I built my very first machine learning algorithm which tells you which eye shape you have and suggests makeup styles matching your particular eye shape to enhances your features. You just snap a photo of your eyes in the app and the algorithm does the rest; telling you which eye shape you have and what makeup style that suits your particular eye shape. I build this app with 3 easy steps and I'm excited to show how you can build yourself an own powerful image classification model, with your own data, within a topic that inspires and interests you. It might sound difficult but I can't wait to show you how few lines of Python you need to build the whole app.\n\nThis talk is for machine learning beginners - by a beginner: I built this classification model with very little experience and the emphasis of this talk is to inform that it is possible to get state of the art results on niches which lack data and that it still exists low having fruits in numerous verticals.\n\nThe essence of the talk is to encourage and inspire to implement data science on niches and verticals that aligns with your own interests.\n\nWhat repetitive and categorizing tasks are you regularly facing? Bring your interests, passion and everyday problems and we'll explore a concrete and more widespread adoption of artificial intelligence solutions.",

All this can be done without heavy maths background, by building on the existing technology, pretrained models and community knowledge.\nSimilar to how web frameworks such as Django make application development easier, there are now several popular ML frameworks such as Keras and PyTorch. They free you from low-level math-intensive coding tasks, and instead make it easy to focus on the higher-level aspects of the problems you're trying to solve.\n\nThe author got started with machine learning less than 1 year ago, after years of doing web development with Python and Django.

    "description": "MySQL 8 is a major redesign of the most popular database on the web. it will have a true data dictionary (no more .frm, MYI, or other little files) which means you can have millions of tables within a schema. Windowing Functions and Common Table Expressions are available, multi plane character support (because you need emojis in your data), user roles, more JSON functions, and big optimizer improvements. And there will be a better 'out of the box' user experience. And you will learn what happened to MySQL 6 and MySQL 7.",

So you can code faster and and not worry as your data evolves. The API calls follow modern coding designs and is much easier to read for those without SQL skills. Plus see the new MySQL shell that has a built in Python interpreter or to allow you to easily manage your data.",

    "description": "Databases are the elephants in the room of modern technology: mature, reliable, sturdy fixtures in the technology world that have served us well for many decades. Databases stay relevant by continuing to reinvent themselves to serve new technologies further up the stack. The latest buzzwords further up that stack are APIs and microservices, so prevalent that it is hard to see a tech advertisement that doesn't mention them. While related to \"the cloud\" and \"big data\", whatever the heck those terms actually mean, APIs and microservices have a slightly less annoying marketing schtick and more concrete relations to relational databases.\n\nBut what do these relations look like in practice? In this talk, Timothy Allen of Wharton Research Data Services will show how his team at The Wharton School has evolved from providing financial data exclusively in SAS data formats to a robust backend powered by PostgreSQL, which allows financial research to happen in many ecosystems: still available in SAS, but also R, Python, Perl, Matlab, Julia, and more. He will present a case study of using Django REST Framework to build an \"API through introspection.\"\n\nThis case study will show how WRDS built a Django web site and RESTful web service by introspecting financial data stored in a PostgreSQL database cluster. The models for the ORM, serializers for the RESTful API, views for presenting the data to a user, filters for refining queries, URL routing, web browsable interface, user token authorization, and permissions, are all handled by introspecting various features of the PostgreSQL database information schema, all with Python.\n\nMany of these components have been open-sourced, such as the ability to export an endpoint as a spreadsheet file (XLSX), and we are hoping to open-source more of it!",
    "bio": "Tim joined Wharton Research Data Services in 2008, after working for local companies and starting a few of his own. Having started programming at age six, he is currently an organizer of the Philadelphia Python Users Group, DjangoCon US, and a member of the Python Software Foundation and Django Software Foundation. Tim is an avid hockey fan, was the first person to sell real world items for virtual microcurrency long before Bitcoin, and enjoys beating his head against brick walls (as demonstrated by his passion for coding, cycling in Philadelphia, and never-ending quest to get his cat to behave). A life-long Philadelphia resident, he graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 1996 with an individualized major, Computer Aided Information Acquisition."

Me neither!* Entering visual representations of recently-changed elements into version control makes review of past changes easier & speeds acclimation to a new web project, especially for visual learners. Surprisingly, methods for including images in your version control aren't standardized and are rarely used outside of large companies, and the rest of us are left checking out every major commit and viewing changes locally! Join me for a review of methods currently in use and discuss the benefits and drawbacks of each. The audience will learn from a survey of tools used by both designers and web developers, what methods are most appropriate for individual projects, & how these methods differ from those used at some of the largest companies (Google, eBay, etc.). Finding a method to track changes in your visual elements will save our future contributors (and future selves!) the pain of having to distinguish #2dc651 (lime green) from #34a34e (darker(!) lime green) and ultimately make our commit histories cleaner and our repos easier to navigate in ways that many of us have never imagined!",

    "bio": "Hola, Soy Wildin Mota. Tengo 18 a\u00f1os de edad y actualmente trabajo como Python Developer en PibiCloud, aunque para cuando llegue la conferencia seguro sere FullStack, incluso hasta haciendo Machine Learning pero eso no es seguro aun.\n\nSoy un apasionado del software desde los 14 estoy en esete mundo estudiando por mi cuenta mi primera intereaccion programando era usando bat en windows el cual aprendi en un libro de HackXRank, desde que inicie nunca lo he dejado y siempre me e mantenido curioso ya el resto es historia de estudio y consistencia.\n\nA mis 17 vendi mi primer proyecto de software el cual era un sistema de ventas para la Ferreteria Chelo, este lo hice en C# y SQL Server estaba muy emociado y motivado que hasta amanecia programando, lo mas duro que hice fueron 14 horas seguidas bebi un monton de cafe ese dia para poder aguantar tal trabajo.\n\nA los 18 al graduarme de bachiller en mi pueblo que es la Vega me senti arrinconado y con un futuro escrito en la vega solo una universidad da Software y no hay empresas en esta area interesantes, ademas estaba ansioso de un cambio drastico, a los pocos dias me inscribi en el ITLA sin consentimiento de mis padres yo trabajaba como tecnico asi que pude pagar yo mismo el derecho a admision y los viajes a santo domingo para los examenes, yo desde hace tiempo queria trabajar mientras estaba en la universidad era algo que queria bastante pero al inscribirme en el ITLA se convirtio en necesidad porque mis padres no podian pagarlo y yo tampoco queria que lo hicieran porque era algo que yo queria y yo debia proveermelo por mi mismo, es importante notar que yo enviaba CV's a solo una emprea a la vez y esperaba hasta que em dieran respuesta porque me parecia mal el hecho de ser aceptado por mas de una y despues tener que rechazar a alguien que me dio una oprtunidad pero despues de ver que eso no funcionaba y viendo la necesidad de tener ingresos entre a emplea.do y mande CV a diestra y siniestra en todas que yo tuviera las requisitos incluso Instacarro me devolvio el mensaje pero pospuse la entrevista sin saber que era algo que no se viea muy bien y no volvi a tener respuesta :'( al final una empresa me escribio a las pocas horas de mandar la soclitud y otra me llamo al siguiente dia, me enfoque en esas dos. Para no alargr la historia me quede con la primera empresa que es Castillo Software Solutions estaba para un puesto que solo era HTML y CSS algo que no me ponia muy feliz pero yo se que lo convertiria en algo mas con el tiempo pedi a la empresa que me dieran issues en Angular y asi fue, eso me mantuvo con retos por un tiempo pero aun para mi no era suficiente yo queria ser backend developer y tenia que serlo de una.\n\nA mis 9-10 meses trabajando en CastilloSS un amigo me mando una oferta laboral como Python Dev usando Django/Flask y ademas haciendo Angular e Ionic tecnologias que aprendi para CastilloSS es curioso decir que cuando pedi hacer tareas en angular aun no habia visto un curso basico completo de Angular pero me manejaba bastante bien con JS y me desenvolvi bien, terminaba mis tareas a tiempo y me dejaron solo haciendo Angular.\n\nPues consegui el trabajo y senti que una puerta de un monton de posibilidades se abrio ante mi, es que en esta empresa mi jefe es un genio con un monton de experiencia dispuesto a mostrarnos todo e incluso hizo una seria de libros para volverse senior si los entiendes bien, los cuales ya estoy leyendo, me gusta bastante donde trabajo ahora y pienso ir a ayudar en tantas areas com pueda no hay limites.\n\nCorte bastante la historia para no escribir mas XD, lo siento.\n\n"
